This solution I am developing is a solution that will fulfil my functional and non-functional requirements from task 1, as well as fulfil the brief set by GibJohn Tutoring:
•	provide interactive teaching and learning resources in a range of subjects
•	provide access to digital content to encourage wider learning
•	support assessment and monitoring of learner progress.
As well as the program having the potential features of:
•	collaborative teaching and learning tools
•	accessibility features to support a wide range of users
•	a learning reward system
•	gamified learning
The functional requirements from task 1:
1.	be able to provide interactive teaching and learning resources in a range of subjects
2.	be able to provide access to digital content to encourage wider learning
3.	able to support assessment and monitoring of learner progress
4.	ensure it is following legislation and regulatory requirements in relation to computers and the education sector so that the solution can operate without legal concerns
5.	include validation to ensure the solution can function as intended while not crashing
6.	feature a logging in system and account creation so that teachers and students can join a class together and track progress as well as do tasks and get resources
7.	log previous work and assessment material completed by students to allow teachers to monitor progress
8.	repository to store work and content for students and users to access
9.	content available for many subjects
10.	user interface
The non-functional requirements from task 1:
1.	allow for collaborative teaching and allow for the use of learning tools
2.	include accessibility features to support a wide range of users
3.	contain a learning reward system
4.	make use of gamified learning
5.	ensure that the solution runs efficiently on all devices to allow for as many to access the solution as possible
6.	scalability to allow for the company to add to the model when new features are needed so that a new solution doesn’t have to be made
7.	readability to ensure that the students can access their work from as many devices as possible with ease for the best learning experience
8.	security to ensure that user details are kept safe so people can’t gain unwanted access to an account
9.	usability to ensure that the solution is fit for purpose and can be easily used to do so
10.	access to free content without logging in
11.	have a simple and eye-catching user interface for students to ensure students of all ages can navigate it as well as being engaging
12.	be able to perform and function well
My solution will be based off of my designs done within task one, and any changes made between the proposal and the outcome will be documented, as well as the parts that are in direct reference to the proposal.
